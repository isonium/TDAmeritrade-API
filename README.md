# TDAmeritrade-API
# Python 3 OAUTH Authentication for TD Ameritrade's API
# Only Linux and Mac are supported, Windows 10 support is problematic (but being looked at.)

 This will ask for your API Key the first time you run it and create a config.json
 It assumes an IP of 127.0.0.1 and PORT 443, but you can edit 'config.json' once created.

 You must first generate SSL certficates for the HTTPS server.

 openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem

 The if you don't have tokens this will open a browser for you to login into your account.
 TD Ameritrade will pass the tokens back to the local HTTPS Server via your browser.
 It's normal to get a security warning from your browser, just accept the certficate you created.
 The tokens will be saved in 'tokens.json'

 Running again will use the refresh token in auth.json to get new tokens if less than six minutes remain.

 You will not need to login again unless your refresh token is expired or is invalidated.

 To keep your tokens.json file updated will valid tokens run.

 ./authenticate.py forever 

 The code is not the best, but it works.

 Visit TD Ameritrade's developer website for more information.

 Use https://127.0.0.1 as your callback URL.

 Code based on example code here.

 On systems that restrict port < 1024 you may need to use 'sudo ./athenticate.py' or equivalent. 

 Requires sys, os, time, json, threading, webbrowser, http.server, urllib.parse, requests, and ssl modules.
